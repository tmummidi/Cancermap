                    The <span class="stateName">[REPLACE STATE/REGISTRY]</span> Cancer Maps project aims to provide data
                    for geographies beyond county-level statistics to better serve cancer control, public health, and

                    <span class="stateName">[REPLACE STATE/REGISTRY]</span> Cancer Maps allows users to interactively

                    called zones, which are aggregates of census tracts. We have used a data-driven approach to define
                    <span class="numZones">[REPLACE NUM_ZONES]</span> zones for <span class="stateName">[REPLACE
                        STATE/REGISTRY]</span>, based on similar characteristics (poverty, urbanicity, racial/ethnic

                    county, but larger than census tract. Zones vary in population size from <span

                    On this website, data are shown by cancer reporting zone. These zones have been designed so that
                    they have a minimum population, have similar demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, and are
                    geographically compact (they minimize the distance between different parts of the zone). The minimum
                    population for each zone is 50,000 people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Counties with larger populations (more than 100,000 people) were divided into multiple zones by
                    combining adjacent census tracts. For the rest of the state, adjacent counties and parts of counties
                    were combined to form zones. Three demographic and socioeconomic characteristics were used to
                    determine similarity: the percent minority population (percent of the population who are not
                    non-Hispanic White), percent of the population with incomes below poverty, and the proportion of the
                    population living in urban and rural areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used population data from Census 2010 and Census 2010 tract geographies to construct the zones.
                    Poverty data came from the American Community Survey 2012-2016 5-year data. We used a software zone
                    design program called <a href="https://www.geodata.soton.ac.uk/software/AZTool/"
                        target="_blank">AZTool</a> to identify aggregations of adjacent tracts and counties that
                    optimize the three objectives: a target population of 50,000, geographic compactness, and similarity

                        Census tract aggregation zones are developed based on combining adjacent census tracts on the
                        basis of similarity in population sociodemographic characteristics: poverty, rurality, and
                        racial/ethnic minority (i.e., non-White) composition. Zones are required to have a minimum
                        population of 50,000. In total, there are <span class="numZones">[REPLACE NUM_ZONES]</span>

                        Cancer is a group of diseases with many possible causes including genetic and clinical factors
                        as well as social determinants of health. Common risk factors for cancer include smoking and
                        tobacco use, diet and physical activity, sun and other types of radiation, viruses (e.g., HPV,
                        Hepatitis B and C), chronic inflammation, and environmental exposures. Neighborhoods may
                        influence cancer through multiple pathways including material deprivation, psychosocial
                        mechanisms, health behaviors, and access to resources.

                    <b>Age-Adjusted Incidence Rate (AAIR):</b> Age-adjustment is a statistical method that allows
                    comparisons of incidence rates to be made between populations with different age distributions. This
                    is important since the incidence of most cancers increases with age. An age-adjusted cancer
                    incidence (or death) rate is defined as the number of new cancers (or deaths) per 100,000 population
                    that would occur in a certain period of time if that population had a ‘standard’ age distribution.
                    In the <span class="stateName">[REPLACE STATE/REGISTRY]</span> Cancer Maps, incidence rates are
                    age-adjusted using the <a href="https://www.census.gov/census2000/states/us.html"
